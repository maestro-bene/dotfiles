# :zap: A set of dotfiles for the ages

This repo contains my Home directory's dotfiles for a smooth experience !

Also checkout my .config repo in order to have the best config out there.
And of course, my ULTIMATE NEOVIM CONFIG is also available if you're tired of not knowing your way around an IDE.
